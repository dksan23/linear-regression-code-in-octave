# linear-regression-code-in-octave with gradient descent

this repository contains the implementation of linear regression with a sample dataset  
the code is to be run in OCTAVE 
uSE lineareg1.m as the driver , if your dataset contains a single feature .
use linregmulti.m if your dataset has multiple features.
Just run the files linregmulti/linearerg1 in the octave command line after making neccessary changes for your dataset.
